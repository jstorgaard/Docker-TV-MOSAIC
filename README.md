## Volumes

TV MOSAIC is quite locked down, directory-wise. Currently only `/share` and `/recordings` are used.

Everything else is splitted up by TV MOSAIC to different files.

Currently the volumes are:

* `/recordings` - Recordings folder. You might have to point it here. **Required**
* `/opt/TVMosaic` - Where all xmltv, transponders, playlists etc is located. **Required**
* `/usr/local/bin/tvmosaic` - Config folder. **Required**

## Ports

It's recommended to run the docker with `--net=host` to be able to use IPTV without issues.

* `9270` - TV MOSAIC port.
* `9271` - TV MOSAIC port.

## Example
Eksample command line:
docker run -it --name=tvmosaic --net=host -p 9270:9270 -p 9271:9271 -v /opt/tvmosaic:/opt/TVMosaic -v /mnt/recordings:/recordings jepsh/docker-tv-mosaic
